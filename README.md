# tauri-website-clone
Was a bit bored while reading tauri documentation so I decided to (mostly) recreate the homepage. I only stole the logo and SVGs, the rest is my own (terrible) code

I only used AI to help me add light mode colors since I initially hard coded dark mode and didn't want to recreate the entire CSS
